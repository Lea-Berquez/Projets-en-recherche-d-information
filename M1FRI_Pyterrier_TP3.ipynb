Donc, chaque page Wikipédia est un document à retrouver.\n","* La liste de résultats sont les candidats pour la liaison référentielle.\n","\n","Considère par exemple la chaîne de caractères « ***Thomas and Mario are strikers playing in Munich*** ». Il existe trois sous-chaînes (***Thomas***, ***Mario*** et ***Munich***) ou mots importants qui sont susceptibles d'être identifiées dans une base de connaissances telle que Wikipédia. Une recherche de ces mots-clés dans les pages Wikipédia produirait de nombreux concepts candidats pour ces sous-chaînes.
